# A SOFTWARE TO MOVE A WINDOW THROUGH HOTKEY
## Background
### Sometimes it is difficult to move a window by mouse due to the low resolution or too big window. Therefore I wrote this software to help people move window through shift and arrow keys.

## Test Platforms

- Windows 10 pro

## Usage

### While the software is running in background, hold shift key, press the arrow key correspond to the direction you hope to move.

## Build Script

### ``` make ```

## TODO List

1. Display menu in the system tray. 
2. Add feature to customize the hot keys.
3. Expand compatibility to more platforms.
